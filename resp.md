                 **Welcome! How can I help you today?**

You've received a $1000 payment into your bank account. This could be due to a transaction or refund from our company.

Unfortunately, this isn't something we directly handle. However, I can offer some guidance on what to do next:

* Check with your bank to confirm the payment and understand any associated fees.
* If you're expecting this payment from us, please contact our customer service team so we can verify the details.

Is there anything else I can help you with today?
